# Markov Process/Chain
A **Markov process** is a memoryless random process. It is a process for which predictions can be made regarding future outcomes based solely on its present state and most importantly such prediction are just as good as the ones that could be made knowing processes full history. Conditional on the present state of the system, and past states are independent. Because we have not formally defined what we mean by dynamics/transitions I will do it here. A **transition** are the changes of state of the system. We define $S$ as a finite set of states with $s \in S$.
