# What is the problem?
We have two opposing forces. 
* Collect data (exploration)
* select choice with highest win-rate (exploit)
It is the explore-exploit dilemma. What applications does it have? 
* Comparing things to see which one is better. Quantitatively compare things. 
# Gaussian vs. Bernoulli
Bernoulli is good for measuring success rates while Gaussian is better for continuous variables. 
# Epsilon-Greedy
Our problem is that we need to balance the explore / exploit ratio. We can
